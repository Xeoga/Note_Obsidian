| Flags |  Description |
|---|---|
|-R|Does a recursive grep search for the files inside the folders(if found in the specified path for pattern search; else grep won't traverse diretory for searching the pattern you specify)|
|-h|If you're grepping recursively in a directory, this flag disables the prefixing of filenames in the results.|
|-c|This flag won't list you the pattern only list an integer value, that how many times the pattern was found in the file/folder.|
|-i|I prefer to use this flag most of the time, this is what specifies grep to search for the PATTERN while IGNORING the case|
|-l|will only list the filename instead of pattern found in it.|
|-n|It will list the lines with their line number in the file containing the pattern.|
|-v|This flag prints all the lines that are NOT containing the pattern|
|-E|This flag we already read above... will consider the PATTERN as a regular expression to find the matching strings.|
|-e|The official documentation says, it can be used to specify multiple patterns and if any string matches with the pattern(s) it will list it.|

## Not here
For strops, we have the following tools that I always keep in my arsenal and you should too:

- [[tr]]
- [[awk]]
- [[sed]]
- [[xargs]]

Other commands to be familiar with:

- [[sort]]
- [[uniq, sort]]
## Recursive 
```bash
grep -r <cuvan> <cale>
```
