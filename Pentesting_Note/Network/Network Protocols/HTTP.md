| **200 - OK**                     | The request was completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **201 - Created**                | A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).                                                                                                                                                        |
| **301 - Moved Permanently**      | This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.                                                                                |
| **302 - Found**                  | Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.                                                                                |
| **400 - Bad Request**            | This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send. |
| **401 - Not Authorised**         | You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.                                                                           |
| **403 - Forbidden**              | You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.                                                                                                                                            |
| **405 - Method Not Allowed**     | The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.                                                            |
| **404 - Page Not Found**         | The page/resource you requested does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **503 - Service Unavailable**    | This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.                                                                                                                                     |
