The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL encryption.

**Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…**

```
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
```

```bash
nmap -sCV -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
```

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```

# Level 20 
Task -> 
```
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

**NOTE:** Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think
```

```bash
#Terminal 1
nc -lp 33333 < /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…
